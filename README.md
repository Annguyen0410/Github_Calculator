Calculator code 8/17/2023

For 2 file .html must create a folder template to split them out of app.py and calculator.py

And also if you want to see a webpage of the code make sure to dowload Flask and Python 3.10 or up!!!!

With Terminal type flask run after dowload python3.10 and Flask will be working perfectly (don't worry its already turn off debug mode of Flask).

And its still having some error so its will be update soon 

BS: My first personal project for my summer!

Thank you very much and have a wonderful day.
